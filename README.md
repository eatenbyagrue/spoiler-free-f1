Website for spoiler free historical F1 results

Built with python & flask & ergast database

I like to watch complete historic motorsport seasons. I usually don't know the results of each particular race. While watching the race, I'd often wish to see the world championship standings and the starting grid for this particular race. But if I look those up, I'll inevitably get the race result spoiled. This website helps.

If someone knows of something similar as ergast but for MotoGP, please let me know!
